You are working on the Fanti project, a flashcard/spaced repetition learning application with gamification elements. The core concept revolves around virtual pets called "Fantis" that help users learn through flashcards organized in decks.

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure
The project's scripts are organized by their type and responsibility:

```
Assets/Scripts/
├── Components/           # MonoBehaviour components
│   ├── Core/            # Core game components (Fanti, Player, etc.)
│   ├── UI/             # UI-specific components
│   └── Events/         # Event-related components
├── Managers/           # Singleton manager MonoBehaviours
├── Models/            # Data models and structures
├── ScriptableObjects/ # ScriptableObject configurations
├── Events/           # Event definitions
└── Utils/            # Utility classes
```

#### Component Organization
- **Components/**: All MonoBehaviour components except managers
  - **Core/**: Main game mechanics and entities
  - **UI/**: User interface components
  - **Events/**: Event listeners and triggers
- **Managers/**: Singleton patterns for game-wide systems
- **Models/**: Data structures and business logic
- **Events/**: Event definitions and systems
- **Utils/**: Helper functions and utilities

### Model-View Separation
- Models (PlayerModel, FantiModel, DeckModel, CardModel) contain data and are serializable
- MonoBehaviours handle Unity-specific functionality and user interactions
- Follow the established pattern of separating data (Models) from behavior (MonoBehaviours)

### Manager Classes
- Use the Singleton pattern for manager classes (GameStateManager, SaveDataManager)
- Ensure proper initialization in Awake() with null checks
- Use DontDestroyOnLoad() for managers that persist across scenes

### Event-Driven Communication
- Use GameEvents for communication between components
- Implement the Observer pattern through GameEvent and GameEventListener
- Avoid direct references between components when possible

## Coding Patterns

### Field Naming
- Private fields use underscore prefix (_variableName)
- Public properties use PascalCase (PropertyName)
- Serialized fields should be grouped at the top of the class

### Documentation
- Use comments to explain complex logic
- Document public methods with summary comments
- Group related functionality with #region directives

### Data Persistence
- Use JSON serialization for saving player data
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization for DateTime objects
- Use the SaveDataManager for centralized data saving/loading

## Game-Specific Features

### Spaced Repetition System
- Cards have easiness factor, interval, and review count
- Algorithm adjusts intervals based on self-assessment scores
- Follow the established pattern in CardModel.Review()

### Fanti Progression
- Fantis gain experience and level up as users study
- Maintain streaks for consistent study
- Implement proper calculation for level progression

### Deck Management
- Cards are organized into decks with different themes
- Support both one-sided and double-sided cards
- Implement proper scheduling of cards based on review dates

## UI Implementation
- Use TextDisplay component for text updates
- Implement proper UI state management
- Follow the established animation patterns using LeanTween
