## Maintaining Systems
When adding a new major system to the project:
1. Add the system name to the Systems list in this file
2. Include a brief description of what the system covers
3. Use the format: `system_name`: Brief description
4. Commit the rules update with: `core - update commit style rules with new system`

## Description Style
- Use lowercase
- Be concise but descriptive
- For fixes, prefix with "fix:"
- For cleanup, prefix with "cleanup:"

## Examples

Basic changes:
```
furniture shop - add new item category
player - implement gold earning system
home - add fanti movement system
fanti - update animation states
```

Fixes:
```

```

Cleanup/Refactoring:

   - Use lowercase
   - Use existing system names when possible
   - Be consistent with naming

2. Description
   - Be clear and concise
